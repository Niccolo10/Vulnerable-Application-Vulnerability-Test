## Project Overview

This repository contains the results of a security testing project conducted by Niccol√≤ Parlanti as part of the Master's Degree in Computer Science at the Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science during the academic year 2022/2023.

### Introduction

The primary objective of this project was to gain practical knowledge in identifying, assessing, and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. The chosen applications for this project were the Bodgeit Store and Vulnerable App, both frequently used for educational purposes due to their simple vulnerabilities that serve as valuable learning opportunities.

#### Bodgeit Store Vulnerabilities

The Bodgeit Store features a range of vulnerabilities, including Cross Site Scripting, SQL injection, Hidden (but unprotected) content, Cross Site Request Forgery, Debug code, Insecure Object References, and Application logic vulnerabilities.

#### Vulnerable App Vulnerabilities

Vulnerable App is designed to work with tools such as automatic scanners and safely exploit vulnerabilities. It includes significant vulnerabilities like Command injection, File upload, Path traversal, SQL injection, XSS, Open redirect, and SSRF.

### Setup

Eclipse was used as the development environment for setting up these applications. Some issues encountered during the setup of the Bodgeit Store were resolved, such as modifying import statements, adjusting project deployment settings, and configuring the Java Build Path. Additionally, specific modifications were made to the web.xml file.

Vulnerable App, on the other hand, was set up without any issues.

### Tools Used

The project employed the following tools:

- **Spotbugs with Find-Sec-Bugs Plugin:** Used for Static Analysis.
- **OWASP ZAP 2.11.1:** Used for Dynamic Analysis.

The configurations for these tools were aligned with the recommendations provided by the professor.

### Project Process

The project followed a systematic process, as outlined below:

1. **Static Analysis (Spotbugs):** Bodgeit Store was analyzed first, resulting in 19 warnings primarily related to weak or vulnerable cryptographic protocols. No vulnerabilities were successfully exploited during this phase.

2. **Dynamic Analysis (OWASP ZAP):** Bodgeit Store was analyzed dynamically, yielding 16 classes of alerts with a total of 1050 possible attack vectors. A manual analysis followed, leading to the successful exploitation of four vulnerabilities.

3. **Dynamic Analysis (OWASP ZAP):** Vulnerable App was analyzed dynamically, resulting in 5 classes of alerts with 36 possible attack vectors.

4. **Static Analysis (Spotbugs):** Vulnerable App was analyzed statically, producing 46 warnings, including 20 categorized as "scary." A manual analysis allowed for the exploitation of the remaining vulnerabilities.
